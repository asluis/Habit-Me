 My ideas are prefixed with a '-'
 
 Part A:
    At the very least, this means there should be a list of all activities they want to track, plus a form to add new activities â€“ a title and description should be enough.
 
    - Navigation View -> List
    - List should display the user's score before they even click on it
        - Similar to iExpense app UI
    - Adding new activities will be done via sheet view
 
Part B:
 
    For a bigger challenge, tapping one of the activities should show a detail screen with the description, how many times they have completed it, plus a button incrementing their completion count.
 
    - Make a custom shape that user can click on (not sure if possible)
    - Inside custom shape will be the number of times they have checked in

 Part C:
    For an even bigger challenge, use Codable and UserDefaults to load and save all your data.
    
    - All data should be a strings and ints, so no need for special implementation

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView{
            Text("Hello, world!")
                .padding()
        }
        
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
    
}
